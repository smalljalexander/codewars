# Code Wars Challenges
This repository is of my code wars journey. The snapshot above I will be continually updating it with my progress.

# How it’s made 

I do a code challenge every day to when I first wake up with coffee in my morning routine

# Lessons learned
I continue learn invaluable lessons whether it’s learning a new method or refactoring my code to make it more readable.
